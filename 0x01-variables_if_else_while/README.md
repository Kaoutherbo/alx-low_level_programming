## 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

- You can find the source code here
- The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
- You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
- The output of the program should be:
  * The number, followed by
  * if the number is greater than 0: is positive
  * if the number is 0: is zero
  * if the number is less than 0: is negative
  - followed by a new line

# Compiles the files :
- The commend for compile the file is : " gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 name_of_file.c -o name_of_file"
- This commend is for compiles the "nam_of_file.c" source code file using the GCC compiler with various warning flags and specifies the output executable as "name_of_file" If there are any warning messages, they will be treated as errors due to the -Werror flag.
 

# Run the files :
- The commend for run a file is : "./name_of_file"
